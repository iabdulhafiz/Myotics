                        <h2>Overview of Myo Coding</h2>
                        <p>
                            The concepts of coding are all the same. No difference. It's just that language (or grammer, syntax) that changes.
                            What's important is that you learn the basics of coding, so to simplify it for you, follow allong!
                        </p>

                        <h4>Rememberring things for later time (Variables)</h4>
                        <p>
                            We call them variables. Things that you store so that later you can use them. To store something, you need a name for it. Then put whatever you want to remember, it can be a number, a person's name, or even an action!
                            The standard way to store something is to say, for example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>make "my age" equal to 13 </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            After that, just call it by its name. Don't forget to use double quotations so the computer knows its your special item (variable).
                        </p>

                        <h4>Doing cool things (Functions)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Again, thanks to the people at P5js, the code can do some pretty cool stuff. The list bellow shows what actions currently work, what they need you to tell them, and and simple example:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Make background color:</strong><em>I can accept 3 colors, red green and blue from 0 to 255</em>
                                <ul><li>make background color 34 red and 78 blue and 255 green </li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Draw a circle:</strong><em>I need the sideways position called x, the up-down posotion called y, and my width (radius)</em>
                                <ul><li>draw a circle at x position of 23, y position of 90 and width of 43 </li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Draw a rectangle (or square):</strong><em>I need the sideways position called x, the up-down posotion called y, and the width and height </em>
                                <ul><li>draw a rectangle at position 34 in x and 73 in y and with width of 100 and height of 98 </li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Change color of shape:</strong><em>I can accept 3 colors, red green and blue from 0 to 255</em>
                                <ul><li>change shape color to 34 red and 78 blue and 255 green </li></ul>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <strong>Write text:</strong><em>I need the sideways position called x, the up-down posotion called y, and the text itself to write</em>
                                <ul><li>write text "Welcome!" at x position of 23, y position of 90 </li></ul>
                            </li>
                            
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Many more are soon to some! As we improve Myo Code, we will try to add more cool features so that you can make many more cool things!
                        </p>

                        <h4>Thinking before doing (Conditions)</h4>
                        <p>
                            These are if-statements, basically because we only do this code <em>if</em> that condition is met. Say you only want to draw a shape if the person's age is over 20. In this case, just give make an if statement before your action.
                            Look at some examples so it makes sense:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>if "my age" is greater than 13 then draw a circle at x position of 23, y position of 90 and width of 43 </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            Remember that "my age" is the thing you saved before. It can be whatever you like as long as you saved it. Now when this line of code it run, it will see what was stored in "my age" and if it is greater than 13, the computer will draw the circle!
                        </p>

                        <h2>Why Does Myo Code Exists?</h2>
                        <p>
                            Apparent complexities in learning to code discourages many students from gaining knowledge and miss out the opportunity to challenge their reasoning and express their ideas. Having revolutionized the modern era, programming enhances critical knowledge, particularly role management and idea expression, that children face in current times. For this reason, we began development of an AI natural language processing system that enables beginners to begin coding in their own native language. The AI is constructed such that any language translated to English would then analyzed to execute the intended code. Consequently, this creates a zero-barrier entry point into the field of programming and hence enhances them in problem solving and design skills.
                        </p>
                        <h2>What Keeps Us Motivated?</h2>
                        <p>
                            We originally began as a team of undergraduate students at Ryerson University in Toronto,
                            Canada. Having worked on design projects and capstone during our studies, we began realizing
                            the need and importance of technology in and how it is rapidly changing the jobs of the
                            future. For this reason, we founded Myotics which aims to be a world-provider for
                            educational toys that enable kids to familiarize themselves with modern technology at a
                            young age. With the help of you and those alike, we hope to make a difference in the living
                            standards of generations to come.
